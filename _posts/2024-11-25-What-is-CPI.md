Introduction - Definition of CPI
------------

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a composite measure of changes in the prices of goods and services consumed by households. The CPI measures people's real purchasing power, which is important for understanding the rate of inflation. The CPI is also used by governments to set economic policy and negotiate wage increases, making it a key indicator for understanding a country's economy.

Introduction - The Need for a Price Index
--------------

The CPI is an important indicator that comprehensively shows the level and fluctuation of prices throughout the economy. It allows us to understand the actual purchasing power of people and the burden of living expenses, and accurately measures the rate of inflation. It is also used by the government to set monetary and fiscal policies based on the CPI, and is also used as a key indicator in wage increase negotiations between companies and workers. In this way, price indexes play an essential role in comprehensively understanding and responding to national economic conditions.

How the CPI is calculated - Selecting the base year
---------------------

The first and most important step in calculating the CPI is to determine the base year, which is the year against which price levels are compared. Choosing a base year is important because it is the basis for calculating the CPI index.

Ideally, you want to choose a base year when the economy was relatively stable. You also want to make sure that you have enough price data for that year because extreme economic conditions, such as booms and busts, can distort prices. The choice of base year is very important because the CPI index is calculated by measuring price changes from year to year based on the base year. We typically change the base year every 5 to 10 years.

How the CPI is calculated - how the weights are determined
----------------------

Weights play a very important role in the calculation of the CPI index. Weights represent the proportion of total consumer spending that each item accounts for, and must be properly reflected to ensure that the CPI is an accurate representation of the true price situation.

Weights are typically determined through the Household Expenditure Survey. Each year, the Office for National Statistics surveys a sample of households about their consumption expenditures and calculates a weight for each item. These calculated percentages are the weights for that item.

The weights take into account a variety of factors, including income level, household type, and geography. For example, low-income households and high-income households may have different spending patterns, and the weights need to be differentiated to reflect this so that the CPI accurately reflects the real purchasing power of all groups. This weighting process is critical to the accuracy of the CPI.

How the CPI is calculated - How items are selected
---------------------

Strict criteria must be applied to the selection of CPI items to ensure that the CPI accurately reflects what people actually spend. First of all, the items included should represent a significant portion of household spending, so that it reflects real-world spending behavior. It should also cover a wide range of item groups, such as food, housing, and healthcare, so that it can measure overall price changes.

New trendy items should be added to the list on an ongoing basis, while outdated items should be excluded to reflect changing consumption trends. Finally, it's important to have reliable price data. These strict criteria for selecting CPI items ensure that the price index accurately reflects real-world consumption patterns.

CPI calculation process - Collecting price data
---------------------

Collecting accurate price data for the selected items is crucial to the calculation of the CPI. The main methods of collecting price data include field surveys, collecting online price information, and reports from producers and retailers. Statistics Korea conducts monthly price surveys by trained surveyors in representative areas across the country, visiting retail stores to collect prices in person. We also collect price information from online shopping malls to increase the representativeness of the data. The price data collected is thoroughly validated to remove outliers and improve accuracy. We maintain a consistent methodology for collecting price data so that we can accurately measure changes over time. This systematic and rigorous price data collection process ensures the reliability and accuracy of the CPI.

CPI calculation process - Weighted average calculation
--------------------

To calculate the CPI, we need to calculate a weighted average by multiplying the price change of each item by the weight of that item, which reflects the share of each item in total consumer spending.

The formula for calculating the weighted average is: Weighted average = Σ (item price change × item weight)

For example, assuming that you have only two items, groceries and clothing, if the price of groceries increased by 5% and the price of clothing decreased by 2%, and if the weights of each item are 0.6 and 0.4, the weighted average is calculated as follows Weighted average = (0.05 × 0.6) + (-0.02 × 0.4) = 0.03 + (-0.008) = 0.022 = 2.2 percent

This means that the overall price is calculated to have increased by 2.2%. This weighted average calculation gives us a composite inflation rate that reflects both the price change and the weight of each item. The CPI index is also calculated using this weighted average calculation.

CPI calculation process - Calculating the index relative to the base year
--------------------------

The CPI index is calculated by measuring the change in prices relative to a base year. The price level in the base year is set to 100, and the index is then calculated by taking the weighted average price change for each year.

For example, if the base year is 2020 and the weighted average price change in 2021 is 3%, then the CPI index for 2021 would be 103. Conversely, if the weighted average price decreased by 1%, the index for 2021 would be 99.

The reason for this base year price level of 100 is to make it easier to compare price changes. At a glance, you can see whether prices have increased or decreased since the base year, and the magnitude of the increase or decrease is intuitively indicated by the index value.

Each year the CPI index is published, it shows how much prices have changed from the base year, so you can get a sense of how people's real purchasing power has changed. In this way, the CPI index is calculated by measuring the change in prices relative to a base year's price level.

Using the CPI to monitor inflation
---------------------

The CPI is the most important indicator for monitoring inflation. For example, if the CPI index has increased by 3% year-over-year, the inflation rate is also 3%. Governments and central banks closely monitor inflation rates through the CPI index, which is released monthly.

Inflation has a significant impact on people's lives and the country's economy, so it's important to keep it under control. High inflation can reduce people's real purchasing power and cause hardship. It can also lead to higher production costs for businesses, which can lead to an economy-wide recession. Conversely, falling inflation can cause businesses to be reluctant to invest due to deteriorating profitability, and employment can decline. This is why maintaining a moderate level of inflation is so important and why continuous monitoring via the CPI is essential.

Using the CPI - Determining wages and social policy
-----------------------

The CPI is an important indicator for setting wage increases and social policy. In wage negotiations, workers seek to preserve their real purchasing power by asking for wage increases that reflect the CPI increase. Conversely, companies need to consider the impact of wage increases on inflation. Governments also rely on the CPI to determine the level and targeting of welfare policies. As prices rise, they may need to increase support, such as subsistence grants or basic pensions, to ease the burden on low-income households. They may also establish policies to support housing and healthcare costs that are indexed to inflation. As such, the CPI is an important indicator for workers, businesses, and governments alike, serving as a key benchmark for wage and social policy decisions.

Using the CPI - Complementing other economic indicators
---------------------

While the CPI is a key measure of inflation, it should be analyzed in conjunction with other key economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment, and consumer confidence to get a comprehensive picture of a country's economy. For example, if inflation is high, but GDP growth is strong and unemployment is low, the economy may be overheating. Conversely, if inflation is low but GDP growth is sluggish and unemployment is high, the economy may be in recession. Therefore, CPI should be considered in conjunction with other economic indicators to provide an accurate picture of economic conditions.

The CPI is also used as a key reference indicator for government macroeconomic policies, such as interest rate policy and tax rate adjustments. For example, if inflation is rising, central banks will raise the benchmark interest rate to control liquidity. As such, CPI is an important basis for macroeconomic policy making and should be considered in conjunction with other economic indicators.

Conclusion - summarizing the role of the CPI
---------------

The CPI is a key indicator that reflects people's real purchasing power and provides a comprehensive measure of price changes. Based on this, it is used to establish wage and welfare policies, which plays an important role in ensuring people's real living standards. In addition, CPI is analyzed together with other economic indicators such as GDP and unemployment rate, contributing to the comprehensive judgment of economic conditions and the establishment of macroeconomic policies. As such, CPI is an indispensable index in various aspects such as stabilizing people's lives, establishing economic policies, and managing the macroeconomy.

Conclusion - Limitations and Future Directions
-------------------

Since the CPI only measures the average price change across the country, it has limitations that do not fully reflect the differences between income groups and regions. It is also difficult to fully reflect changes in the market environment, such as the introduction of new products or changes in product quality. Therefore, the CPI needs continuous improvement and supplementation to become a more accurate price index.

First, we need to calculate price indexes by income group, household type, and region to reflect the actual cost of living changes for different groups. We also need to introduce more sophisticated measures for items that account for a large share of household spending, such as housing and healthcare. The way we account for new products will also need to continue to improve, and changes in value due to changes in quality will need to be taken into account, so that the CPI more accurately reflects changes in the cost of living across the country.
